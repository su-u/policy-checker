You will promptly remedy such breach or potential vulnerability resulting from your access to the Licensed Material.</p>

                            <p><b>IV. Updates and Removals</b></p>
                            <p><b>A. Updates.</b>&nbsp; Twitter may update, modify or discontinue any features or function of the Licensed Material, in whole or in part, from time to time (in each instance, an <b>“Update”</b>).

Ownership. </b>Except to the extent expressly stated otherwise in the Agreement, neither party will acquire any right, title or interest in any Intellectual Property Rights owned or licensed by the other party. The Licensed Material is licensed, not sold, and Twitter (or its licensors or Twitter Application users, as applicable) retains and reserves all rights, including all Intellectual Property Rights, not expressly granted in this Agreement. You shall not do anything inconsistent with Twitter’s ownership, including without limitation, challenging Twitter’s ownership of the Twitter Marks, challenging the validity of the licenses granted in this Agreement, or otherwise copying or exploiting the Twitter Marks, except as specifically authorized in this Agreement.

                            <p><b>B. Betas. </b>Twitter may provide you with early access to non-generally available alphas, betas, research studies, pilots, marketing services or other programs from time to time (each, a “<b>Beta</b>”). Betas will be considered Twitter Confidential Information.

                            <p><b>C. Feedback.</b>&nbsp; Twitter will be free to use any feedback, comments or suggestions you provide Twitter related to Twitter, the Licensed Material, Betas or any other of Twitter’s products or services (“<b>Feedback</b>”) in any way without any compensation or obligation to you or any third party, and Feedback will be deemed the Confidential Information of Twitter.&nbsp; You hereby irrevocably assign to Twitter all right, title, and interest to Feedback.</p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            <p><b>VI. Confidentiality. </b>You may be given access to non-public information, software, and specifications relating to the Licensed Material (“<b>Confidential Information</b>”). You may use Confidential Information only as necessary in exercising your rights under this Agreement. You shall not disclose Confidential Information to any third party without Twitter’s prior written consent. You shall protect Confidential Information from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that you would use to protect your own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.</p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            <p><b>VII. Term; Subscription Fees; Payment; Suspension, and Termination.&nbsp;</b></p>
                            <p><b>A. Term.</b> The term of this Agreement will start on the earlier of the date you accept them or otherwise start accessing or using any of the Licensed Material, and will continue until you stop accessing and using the Licensed Material, unless terminated earlier as described below.</p>
                            <p><b>B. Subscription Terms. </b>Paid Services provided as part of the Licensed Material are made available as a recurring subscription service that provides access to certain features, benefits, or services, as described on the Developer Site and the Payment Portal. If you purchase Paid Services, you do so by paying a subscription fee in advance on a monthly basis in accordance with the payment terms set forth below. When you subscribe to access the Paid Services via the Payment Portal, you expressly agree that you are authorizing recurring payments, and that payments will be made by the payment method you have selected until the applicable Paid Services is canceled by you or by Twitter or the Agreement is otherwise terminated. Your subscription to the Paid Service will automatically renew monthly until canceled in accordance with this Agreement. Your payment information will be automatically processed by Twitter’s Payment Processor (defined below) at the start of each subscription period applicable to the Paid Services. If your payment information is declined, your subscription may be canceled until you provide new payment information for the applicable Paid Services. If you provide new payment information and your payment account is successfully charged, your new subscription period will be based on the original renewal date and not the date the successful charge took place. Prices for Paid Services are subject to change from time to time. Twitter will provide reasonable advance notice of any material change to the price of Paid Services, which notice may be provided via the Developer Site. For subscription fees, price changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change. If you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by canceling your subscription to the applicable Paid Service prior to the price change going into effect.</p>
                            <p><b>C. Payment Terms. </b>Twitter may offer payment options that vary by Paid Service, device, operating system, geographic location, or other factors, which may be updated from time to time. These payment options may include web payments using a third party payment processor (“<b>Payment Processor</b>”). When you access a Paid Service, you agree: (i) to pay the price listed for the Paid Service, along with any additional amounts relating to applicable taxes, credit card fees, bank fees, foreign transaction fees, foreign exchange fees, and currency fluctuations, on a recurring basis during the applicable subscription period; and (ii) to abide by any applicable terms of service, privacy policies, or other legal agreements or restrictions (including additional age restrictions) imposed by the Payment Processor in connection with your use of a given payment method. The subscription fee will automatically be applied at the start of the renewal period for the applicable subscription period unless you cancel the Paid Services on the&nbsp; Developer Site.&nbsp; It is your responsibility to make sure your banking, credit card, debit card, and/or other payment information is up to date, complete and accurate at all times. If you make a payment for a Paid Service through a Payment Processor, Twitter may receive information about your transaction such as when it was made, when a subscription is set to expire or auto- renew, what platform you made the purchase on, and other information. Twitter will not be liable for any errors made or delays by the Payment Processor, your bank, your credit card company or any payment network. All payments to Twitter are non-refundable except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or as required by law.</p>
                            <p><b>D.</b> <b>Taxes and fees.</b> All fees exclude any and all taxes and similar fees now in force, enacted or imposed in the future on the transaction, delivery of the Licensed Material or the delivery of the Twitter Content including any sales, use or value added taxes, goods and services tax, consumption tax, customs duties, tariffs, or similar charges.&nbsp; These taxes may include, but are not limited to, VAT, GST, sales tax, withholding tax, and any other applicable taxes, but exclude taxes solely based on Twitter’s net income.&nbsp; You are responsible for the payment of all such taxes, duties and charges, and any related penalties and interest arising from the payment of such amounts. Depending on your location, Twitter may be responsible for collecting and reporting information related to transaction taxes arising from your purchase of Paid Services.&nbsp; You grant Twitter permission to provide your account and personal information to relevant tax authorities to fulfill our tax collection and reporting obligations.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p><b>E.&nbsp;</b> <b>Canceling Your Subscription for Paid Services</b>.&nbsp; Your subscription for Paid Services will automatically renew monthly unless you cancel your subscription at least 24 hours before the end of your current subscription period. There are no refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods, including in a situation where certain features, benefits and/or services are modified or discontinued. SUBSCRIPTION PLANS ARE PREPAID, NON-REFUNDABLE (UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW), AND AUTOMATICALLY RENEW AT THE END OF EACH SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD UNLESS THE SUBSCRIPTION IS CANCELED FOLLOWING THE CANCELLATION PROCEDURES BELOW. You may cancel your subscription for Paid Services at any time via the Developer Site and you will no longer have access to the Paid Services (or any features or functionality thereof) at the end of your then-current subscription term. When you cancel the Paid Services, your subscription will remain active from the time you cancel until the end of your current subscription period. You will not receive a refund or credit for any remaining days in your current subscription period, unless required by law.&nbsp;<b> </b>All payments for Paid Services are final and not refundable or exchangeable, except as required by applicable law. Twitter makes no guarantee as to the nature, quality, or value of a Paid Service or the availability or supply thereof. Refunds or credits are not provided for any unused or partially used Paid Service (for example, a partially used subscription period).&nbsp; <b>All Transactions are Final</b>, unless you have a right to withdraw pursuant to law, such as provided below<b>.&nbsp;</b></p>
                            <p><b>1. Withdrawal Right &amp; Refunds for Users Living in EU or UK</b>. When you purchase any Paid Services on subscription, you expressly agree to do so on a subscription basis and that the subscription will commence immediately on your date of purchase. If you are a consumer in an EU Member State or the UK, you agree you have fourteen (14) days after your purchase to withdraw from your contract for purchase for any reason.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p><b>2. No Withdrawal Right for Users Living in Taiwan.</b> When you purchase Paid Services, you do so on a subscription basis, the subscription will commence immediately on your date of purchase, and the Paid Service is fully performed once begun. If you are in Taiwan, you agree that you can cancel your subscription for any Paid Services in accordance with subsection E (Canceling Your Subscription for Paid Services) above, but that there is otherwise no right to rescind your Subscription and no refund will be issued.</p>
                            <p><b>F. Paid Services Are Non-Transferable between Twitter Accounts</b>. Each purchase of a Paid Service applies to a single Twitter account, meaning that your purchase will apply solely to the account you were using when you purchased the Paid Service and will not apply to other accounts that you may have access to, or control over. If you have or control multiple accounts and you want access to Paid Services on each account, you must purchase the Paid Service on each account individually.&nbsp; You may not allow others to use your Twitter account to access any Licensed Material that such person did not order. You may not purchase a Paid Service or use any Licensed Material&nbsp; if you are a person with whom U.S. persons are not permitted to have dealings pursuant to economic sanctions, including, without limitation, sanctions administered by the United States Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control or any other applicable sanctions authority ("<b>Prohibited Person</b>"). This includes, without limitation, persons located in, or a citizen of, or ordinarily resident in, the following countries and regions: Cuba, Iran, the Crimea Region of Ukraine, North Korea and Syria. You represent and warrant that you are not a Prohibited Person.</p>
                            <p><b>G. Restrictions and Obligations.</b>&nbsp; You may only purchase and use a Paid Service or use the Licensed Material if you are legally allowed to use the Licensed Material&nbsp; in your country and you live in a country supported by Twitter for the applicable Paid Service or Licensed Material. Twitter may, in its discretion, restrict the ability to access the Licensed Material or purchase a Paid Service in certain countries. Twitter reserves the right to modify the list of supported countries from time to time.&nbsp; Twitter reserves the right to refuse Paid Services transactions or to cancel or discontinue the sale or use of a Paid Service or the use of any Licensed Material in our sole discretion.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p><b>H. Suspension.</b> Twitter may suspend your use of and access to the Licensed Material immediately without notice, including (a) if Twitter reasonably believes that (i) your use of the Licensed Material would cause damage to, or an inordinate burden upon, the Licensed Material, (ii) you have violated this Agreement, (iii) you create risk or possible legal exposure for Twitter, (iv) Twitter’s provision of the Licensed Material&nbsp; to you is no longer commercially viable; (b) for prolonged inactivity; (c) if Twitter is requested or directed to do so by any competent court of law, regulatory authority, or law enforcement agency; or (d) for failure to pay for the Paid Services. Twitter will not be liable for damages of any sort that result from any such suspension.</p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            <p><b>I. Termination.</b> Twitter may terminate this Agreement for any reason, at Twitter’s sole discretion.&nbsp; Except where such early termination is the result of your breach of this Agreement, such early termination by Twitter shall be effective at the end of the then-current subscription period. &nbsp; If you violate the terms of this Agreement, Twitter may terminate this Agreement for cause immediately upon notice to you and you will not receive a prorated refund for any Paid Services.&nbsp; You may cancel your subscription for the Paid Services or your use of the Licensed Material on the Developer Site. Upon termination of this Agreement: (a) all licenses granted in this Agreement immediately expire and you must cease use of all Licensed Material; and (b) you shall permanently delete all Licensed Material in all forms and types of media, and copies thereof, in your possession. The parties to this Agreement will not be liable to each other for any damages resulting solely from termination of this Agreement as permitted under this Agreement.</p>
                            <p><b>VIII. Compliance Audit</b>.&nbsp; Twitter or a mutually agreed upon third party agent subject to obligations of confidentiality will be entitled to inspect and audit any records related to the performance of this Agreement in your control or possession upon reasonable notice to you, and at a reasonable time during normal business hours, for the purpose of verifying compliance with this Agreement and the fees payable to Twitter for the two (2) year period preceding the audit (the “Audit Period”).&nbsp; Twitter may exercise its audit right no more than once every twelve (12) months, unless it has reasonable cause for noncompliance, and such audit shall not unreasonably interfere with your business activities.&nbsp; You&nbsp; will provide your full cooperation and assistance with such audit and provide access to all Licensed Material in your possession, applicable agreements and records. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as part of the audit, Twitter may request, and you agree to provide, a written report, signed by an authorized representative, listing Customer’s then-current deployment of the Licensed Material. You will pay Twitter within thirty (30) business days after the completion of the audit the amount of any underpayment revealed by any such audit.&nbsp; In addition, if any such audit reveals an underpayment by you of five percent (5%) or more, then you will also reimburse Twitter for the reasonable costs and expenses of such audit. The requirements of this Section will survive for one (1) year following the termination of this Agreement.</p>
                            <p>Twitter, or a third-party agent subject to obligations of confidentiality, may inspect and audit any records or activity related to your access to the Licensed Material to verify compliance with this Agreement. Twitter may exercise its audit right at any time upon notice.

Twitter may assume full control of the defense of claims with legal counsel of its choice. You shall not enter into any third-party agreement that would affect the rights of Twitter, constitute an admission of fault by Twitter, or bind Twitter in any manner, without the prior written consent of Twitter. If Twitter assumes control of the defense of such claim, Twitter shall not settle any such claim requiring payment from you without your prior written approval.</p>

                              <li><b>Binding Arbitration. </b>If we cannot reach an agreed upon resolution with you regarding a Dispute within a period of thirty (30) days from the time informal dispute resolution commences under the Initial Dispute Resolution provision above, then either you or we may initiate binding arbitration, which will be the sole means to resolve any Dispute, subject to the terms set forth below and except for claims brought in small claims court or unless you opt out. Specifically, all Disputes shall be finally resolved exclusively through binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“<b>AAA</b>”) in San Francisco, CA, and through a single mutually agreed upon arbitrator, in accordance with the provisions of the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules, available at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1.800.778.7879.<b> YOU AND TWITTER HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR JUDGE.</b></li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute, including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of these Twitter Developer Agreement are void or voidable, or whether a Dispute is subject to arbitration. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity, provided that such relief (including injunctive relief) is limited to your individual circumstances. Notwithstanding the requirements of this arbitration provision, if the Dispute involves a claim for public injunctive relief, you may choose to sever that claim from the arbitration proceeding and bring it in any court of proper jurisdiction. The arbitrator’s award shall be written and binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
                            <p>YOU HAVE ONE YEAR TO BRING A CLAIM AGAINST TWITTER, UNLESS YOU OPT OUT. You must bring any claim against Twitter within one (1) year after the date on which the claim arose, unless applicable law provides that the normal statute of limitations for that claim may not be shortened by agreement. If you do not bring a claim within this period, you waive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, all rights you have to such claim and Twitter will have no liability with respect to such claim.</p>
                            <ol>
                              <li><b></b>Filing Process and Costs. To start an arbitration, you can get submission instructions at: https://adr.org/Support. Twitter will pay your initial filing fee of $200 and costs of the arbitration up to the extent required and as defined in the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules, but in no greater amounts than those set forth in this provision. If, however, the arbitrator determines that claims were filed for the purposes of harassment or were patently frivolous, the arbitrator can reallocate the arbitrator’s compensation and administrative fees, including the filing and hearing fees, as set forth in the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules. The arbitration rules also permit you to recover attorneys’ fees in certain cases. The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.</li>
                              <li><b></b>Location. Arbitration will take place on a documents-only basis or you can choose to conduct the proceedings by telephone, video, or in-person. For in-person arbitration, the proceedings will be in the city or county where you reside or, if you do not reside in the United States, in the State of California, County of San Francisco.&nbsp;</li>
                              <li><b></b>Class Action Waiver. <b>YOU AND WE FURTHER AGREE THAT ANY CLAIMS MAY ONLY BE BROUGHT IN OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES AND NOT ON BEHALF OF, OR AS PART OF, A CLASS ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. THE PARTIES EXPRESSLY WAIVE THEIR RIGHT TO FILE A CLASS ACTION OR SEEK RELIEF ON A CLASS BASIS.</b> Unless you and we both agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate proceedings or more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of representative or class proceeding.</li>
                              <li><b></b>30-Day Right to Opt Out.&nbsp; If you wish to opt out and not be bound by these arbitration provisions set forth above, you can send written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address:</li>

If you opt out of those provisions, Twitter also will not be bound by them.</p>

                              <li><b></b>Injunctive Relief. Despite the foregoing, you agree that money damages would be an inadequate remedy for Twitter in the event of a breach or threatened breach of this Agreement protecting Twitter's intellectual property or Confidential Information, and that in the event of such a breach or threat, Twitter, in addition to any other remedies to which it is entitled, is entitled to such preliminary or injunctive relief (including an order prohibiting Company from taking actions in breach of such provisions), without the need for posting bond, and specific performance as may be appropriate. The parties agree that neither the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, nor the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act shall apply to this Agreement, regardless of the states in which the parties do business or are incorporated. No waiver by Twitter of any covenant or right under this Agreement will be effective unless memorialized in a writing authorized by Twitter.</li>

                            <p><b>A.</b> If you live in the United States, these Terms will be governed by the laws of the State of California and any Dispute that arises between you and Twitter will be subject to Section 6 above (Dispute Resolution Agreement -- Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver). &nbsp;</p>
                            <p><b>B.</b> If you live in an EU Member State, an EFTA State, or the UK, the mandatory laws of your country of residence will apply and legal proceedings may be brought in relevant courts according to and under your country of residence’s laws.&nbsp;</p>

                            <p><b>A. Assignment</b>. You shall not assign any of the rights or obligations granted hereunder, in whole or in part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, contract, merger (whether you are the surviving or disappearing entity), stock or asset sale, consolidation, dissolution, through government action or otherwise, except with the prior written consent of Twitter. Twitter is authorized to sign modifications and consents for Twitter International Unlimited Company, an Irish company responsible for the information of Twitter users who live outside the United States.

                            <p><b>B. User Protection.</b> Unless explicitly approved by Twitter in writing, you shall not use, or knowingly display, distribute, or otherwise make Twitter Content, or information derived from Twitter Content, available for purpose of: (a) conducting or providing surveillance or gathering intelligence, including but not limited to investigating or tracking Twitter users or Twitter Content; (b) conducting or providing analysis or research for any unlawful or discriminatory purpose, or in a manner that would be inconsistent with Twitter users' reasonable expectations of privacy; (c) monitoring sensitive events (including but not limited to protests, rallies, or community organizing meetings); or (d) targeting, segmenting, or profiling individuals based on sensitive personal information, including their health (e.g., pregnancy), negative financial status or condition, political affiliation or beliefs, racial or ethnic origin, religious or philosophical affiliation or beliefs, sex life or sexual orientation, trade union membership, Twitter Content relating to any alleged or actual commission of a crime, or any other sensitive categories of personal information prohibited by law.</p>
                            <p><b>C.
