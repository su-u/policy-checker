                              <p>X loves developers. We’re delighted and amazed by the tools and services this community creates by harnessing the power of X data. As part of our commitment to this community, we aim to provide data access that is open and fair for developers, safe for people on X, and beneficial for the X platform as a whole. To further these goals we’ve crafted the Developer Policy as a guide to help people understand our rules and expectations about appropriate API and X Content usage.</p>
                              <p>This Developer Policy (“<b>Policy</b>”) provides rules and guidelines for developers who interact with X’s ecosystem of applications, services, website, web pages and content. It is part of your contract with X governing access to and use of the X API and X Content (either as part of the Developer Agreement or other written agreement with X). Policy violations are considered violations of your agreement. This Policy may be changed from time to time without notice. Capitalized terms used in this Policy, which are not defined in this Policy, will have the respective meanings ascribed to them in the <a href="https://developer.x.com/developer-terms/agreement" rel="nofollow">Developer Agreement</a> or the Master License Agreement.</p>

                              <p>We’ve structured this policy to make it as easy to follow as possible. Please keep information from the following policy sections top of mind as you use the X API and X Content:</p>
                              <p><b>1. Set Yourself Up for Success</b><span> -&nbsp;You are responsible for complying with all X policies. It’s important that you review and understand this Policy, as well as the policies we link to in this document, before you access the X API and X Content. The time spent reviewing our policies may save you hours of rework down the road.</span></p>
                              <p><b>2. Privacy and Control are Essential</b> - Protecting and defending the privacy of people on X is built into the core DNA of our company. As such, we prohibit the use of X data in any way that would be inconsistent with people’s reasonable expectations of privacy. By building on the X API or accessing X Content, you have a special role to play in safeguarding this commitment, most importantly by respecting people’s privacy and providing them with transparency and control over how their data is used.</p>
                              <p><b>3. Follow the Platform Usage Guidelines</b> - Getting approved to access the X API and X Content is just the first step. Our Platform Usage Guidelines should be your first stop anytime you have questions about how to ensure policy compliance for your planned use of the X platform.</p>
                              <p>We’ve provided a lot more detail on what each of these three key sections mean below. Please review them carefully to ensure that your usage of the X API and X Content is consistent with our policies.&nbsp;</p>
                              <p>If we believe you are in violation of this Policy (or any other X policy), we may suspend or permanently revoke your access to the X API and X Content.&nbsp;</p>
                              <p>Finally, please note that X may monitor your use of the X API to improve the X Applications, to examine any commercial use, and to ensure your compliance with your approved use case and this Policy.</p>
                              <p>Thanks for reading, and thank you for building with us! We look forward to seeing what you create!</p>

                              <p>You can avoid many potential pitfalls while using the X API by ensuring that your service has been built the right way from day 1. This section of the Developer Policy contains rules that all developers must follow before using the X API or X Content.</p>
                              <p>The Free, Basic, and Pro plans (as described at <a href="http://developer.x.com/en" rel="nofollow">developer.x.com/en</a>) are designed for hobbyists, commercial prototyping, early-stage X product integrations, and supporting applications with limited end-users. If you use the X API and X Content beyond this scope, then you must apply (or already subscribe to) an Enterprise plan (as described at <a href="http://developer.x.com/en" rel="nofollow">developer.x.com/en</a>).</p>
                              <p><b>We review all proposed uses of the X developer platform to verify policy compliance — so you’re required to disclose (and update, as applicable) your planned use of the X API and X Content in order to be granted and to maintain access.</b> All new developers must <a href="https://developer.x.com/portal/petition/essential/basic-info" rel="nofollow">apply for a developer account</a> to access the X API. Current developers without an approved developer account must apply for one as directed to do so by X. As part of this process, you’ll need to provide us with a written description of your intended uses of the X API and X Content.</p>
                              <p>Your use case description is binding on you, and any substantive deviation from it may constitute a violation of our rules and result in enforcement action. You must notify us of any substantive modification to your use case and receive approval before you may begin using X Content for that new purpose. Failure to do so may result in suspension and termination of your API and data access.&nbsp;</p>
                              <p><b>By building on the X API or accessing X Content, you must comply with ALL X policies.</b> These include this <a href="https://developer.x.com/developer-terms/policy" rel="nofollow">Developer Policy</a>, the <a href="https://help.x.com/rules-and-policies/x-automation" rel="nofollow">Automation Rules</a>, the <a href="https://developer.x.com/developer-terms/display-requirements.html" rel="nofollow">Display Requirements</a>, the <a href="https://developer.x.com/developer-terms/more-on-restricted-use-cases" rel="nofollow">API Restricted Uses Rules</a>, the <a href="https://help.x.com/rules-and-policies/x-rules" rel="nofollow">X Rules</a>, and the <a href="https://about.x.com/who-we-are/brand-toolkit" rel="nofollow">X Brand Resources</a>, as well as any other agreements you enter into with X relating to your use of the X API or X Content, including but not limited to the <a href="https://developer.x.com/developer-terms/agreement" rel="nofollow">Developer Agreement</a> or a Master Licensing Agreement or Order (as applicable). You must also comply with any modifications to these policies and any new policies launched by X. It is your responsibility to monitor the use of your service and to design your service to prevent violations of X policy by people who use it. Failure to do so may result in suspension or termination of your API and X Content access.</p>
                              <p><b>You may not register multiple applications for a single use case or substantially similar or overlapping use cases.</b> In this context, a “use case” is a consistent set of analyses, displays, or actions performed via an application. "White label" versions of a tool or service are not permissible.&nbsp;If you plan to “white label” versions of your application, you must notify and receive separate approval from us.</p>
                              <p><i>As a single exception to these rules,</i> you may create and use a maximum of 3 applications for development, staging, and production instances of the same service. These apps must be registered to a single account, and should be clearly identified (in the name and description) as dev, staging, and prod instances of a single service. <b>You may not use development or staging applications for production purposes.</b><br>
                              </p>
                              <p><b>You must keep all API keys or other access credentials private.&nbsp;</b>You may not use, and may not encourage or facilitate others to use, API keys or other access credentials owned by others.</p>
                              <p><b>Your license agreement with X limits your use of the X API and X Content. Among other things, the X API has rate limits which help to ensure fair data usage and to combat spam on the platform.</b> You may not exceed or circumvent rate limits, or any other limitations or restrictions described in this Policy or your agreement with X, listed on the <a href="https://developer.x.com/" rel="nofollow">Developer Site</a>, or communicated to you by X.</p>
                              <p><b>You may not remove or alter any proprietary notices or marks on X Content received via the X API.</b> This helps to make sure that people know where X Content is coming from, and who it belongs to.</p>
                              <p><b>For data integrity and platform health reasons, you may not interfere with, intercept, disrupt, or disable any features of the X API or the X service.</b> In other words, use the APIs as intended and documented on <a href="https://developer.x.com/" rel="nofollow">developer.x.com</a>.

Any use of the X developer platform, X API, or X Content in a manner that is inconsistent with peoples’ reasonable expectations of privacy may be subject to enforcement action, which can include suspension and termination of API and X Content access.</p>
                              <p>Your commitment to privacy and control must extend to all uses of X Content and all aspects of the service that you build using our API. To that end, the people using your service must understand and consent to how you use their data, and how you access X on their behalf. This can be accomplished through providing people with a clear, comprehensive, and transparent privacy policy, as well as ensuring that you get express and informed consent from each person using your service before taking any action on their behalf. <b>Please note that a person authenticating into your service does not by itself constitute consent. </b></p>

If you can answer yes to these two questions, then you are ready to start using the X API and X Content. X’s Platform Usage Guidelines provide the assistance needed to ensure that your use of X Content is compliant from day 1 throughout the lifecycle of your service. We suggest reviewing these rules on a regular basis to make sure that your integration is operating in a way that is safe and beneficial to people on X and the X platform as a whole.</p>
