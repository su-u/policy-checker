                      <p>Filtering/query operator “aliases” were added to search and filtered stream endpoints, across enterprise, premium, and v2. In many cases, the operator refers to posts instead of statuses, e.g. “in_reply_to_tweet_id” as an alias for “in_reply_to_status_id.” In other cases, the new operator alias adds more clarity to the matching performed. For example., since posts can only have one video attachment, a new “has:video_link” alias is provided for “has:videos.” Check out the&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.x.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/filtered-stream/integrate/build-a-rule#list" rel="noreferrer">v2 filtered stream operator table</a>&nbsp;to see more examples.</p>

                      <p>Today, all developers can now authenticate using OAuth 2.0 by selecting OAuth 2.0 as an authentication method in the developer portal. We’ve added support for confidential and public clients and all relevant v2 endpoints to use this authentication method as part of this release.&nbsp;</p>
                      <p>OAuth 2.0 is an industry-standard authorization protocol that provides developers more control over an application’s scopes and improves authorization flows across multiple devices. In other words, developers building applications for people on X will have more control over the information their App requests from its users, so that you only have to ask your end-users for the data and information you need.&nbsp;</p>
                      <p>This modern authorization protocol will allow you to present your end-users with a more streamlined consent flow for authorizing your app, which only displays the specific scopes you have requested from them.</p>

                      <p>Today, we are announcing that X API v2 is now the primary version of the X API. We have launched enough endpoints and functionality into X API v2 to satisfy the needs of 90% of all existing Apps built on the X API.&nbsp;</p>
                      <p>We are launching the following changes today to further improve upon the X API v2 developer experience:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          <p>Fast and free Essential access to the API, and free Elevated access to developers who have had their use cases approved. We have a lot more details on these access levels available on our About the X API page.&nbsp;</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <p>We are removing language in our Developer Policy that restricted how you build with X’s core features, and limited the number of users you can support through your app.</p>

                            <li>

                              <p>Specifically, we’ve removed terms that restricted replication of the X experience, including X’s core features as well as terms that required permission to have high numbers of user tokens.&nbsp;</p>

                              <p>We know that building solutions that help people on X often means a developer has to build (or replicate) some of the things that are available on X. These changes to our Developer Policy are intended to drive clarity for the developer ecosystem and provide an open API platform that makes it easier for developers to build, innovate, and make an impact on the public conversation.</p>

                      <p>Today, we are introducing a new operator,&nbsp;is:reply, to help you narrow conversations to those you care about most. You can now filter out replies from your results (in addition to the pre-existing ability to filter out reposts,&nbsp;is:retweet, and Quoted posts,&nbsp;is:quote). This new operator is available today within&nbsp;<a href="/x-api/enterprise-gnip-2.0/powertrack-api">PowerTrack</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.x.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/tweets/batch-historical/overview" rel="noreferrer">Historical PowerTrack</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="/x-api/enterprise-gnip-2.0/powertrack-api#replay-api">Replay</a>.</p>
                      <p>The&nbsp;is:reply&nbsp;Boolean operator can be used to filter all replies to posts, or to filter out explicit replies that match a rule. This operator functions in the same way as the&nbsp;is:quote&nbsp;operator.</p>
                      <p>You can learn more about this operator in the&nbsp;<a href="/x-api/enterprise-gnip-2.0/fundamentals/rules-filtering">documentation</a>. &nbsp;</p>

                      <p>With the system update, users will experience a data “hole” as developers will only be able to pull data back to May 1, 2018. Therefore for the upcoming year, they will be missing out on a few months of historical data (until June 2019).</p>
                      <p>A product name is changing within the Usage API from&nbsp;Historical PowerTrack Subscription&nbsp;to&nbsp;Historical PowerTrack 2.0&nbsp;which will make the product naming consistent with the rest of our user-facing wording. Customers will receive the exact same data in the same format with the update. You will see this change within the&nbsp;products.type&nbsp;JSON object.</p>

                      <p>Today, we are announcing a change to the way that URLs will be rendered in the quote payload.</p>
                      <p>We’re adding a new entity called the “quoted_status_permalink” entity to ensure the quoted post can be referenced and we will be removing the t.co link from the quoted post “text” field.</p>
                      <p>With the new format, the t.co link is no longer appended to the “text” field of the quoted post in the “quoted_status” object.</p>
                      <p>Further, we will no longer put the quoted post t.co url, expanded_url, and display_url in the ‘urls’ entity. Instead, these will be added to a new “quoted_status_permalink” object with “url”, “expanded”, and “display” URL attributes. This means that the “quoted_status_permalink” object will be reserved for the t.co link back to the quoted post, whereas the “entities.urls” array can be used to identify any links shared within the original post or quote.</p>
