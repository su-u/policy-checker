                                  <p>Filtering/query operator "aliases" were added to search and filtered stream endpoints, across enterprise, premium, and v2. In many cases, the operator refers to posts instead of statuses, e.g. "in_reply_to_tweet_id" as an alias for "in_reply_to_status_id." In other cases, the new operator alias adds more clarity to the matching performed. For example., since posts can only have one video attachment, a new "has:video_link" alias is provided for "has:videos." Check out the&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/filtered-stream/integrate/build-a-rule#list">v2 filtered stream operator table</a><span>&nbsp;to see more examples.</span></p>

                                  <p>Today, all developers can now authenticate using OAuth 2.0 by selecting OAuth 2.0 as an authentication method in the developer portal.

                                  <p>OAuth 2.0 is an industry-standard authorization protocol that provides developers more control over an application’s scopes and improves authorization flows across multiple devices. In other words, developers building applications for people on X will have more control over the information their App requests from its users, so that you only have to ask your end-users for the data and information you need.&nbsp;</p>
                                  <p>This modern authorization protocol will allow you to present your end-users with a more streamlined consent flow for authorizing your app, which only displays the specific scopes you have requested from them.</p>

                                  <p>We are launching the following changes today to further improve upon the X API v2 developer experience:</p>

                                    <li>Fast and free Essential access to the API, and free Elevated access to developers who have had their use cases approved. We have a lot more details on these access levels available on our About the X API page.&nbsp;</li>

                                    <li>We are removing language in our Developer Policy that restricted how you build with X’s core features, and limited the number of users you can support through your app.<ul>
                                        <li>We are opening up our platform to encourage you to build tools and products that make X better, healthier, and extend the public conversation. <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/what-to-build">See a list of solutions we’d love to see you build</a>.&nbsp;</li>

                                        <li>We know that building solutions that help people on X often means a developer has to build (or replicate) some of the things that are available on X.

                                  <p>Today, we’re launching a beta of OAuth 2.0 and fine-grained scopes on the X API v2. . Developers interested in shaping the future of OAuth 2.0 on the X Developer Platform, can request access to the OAuth 2.0 beta.&nbsp;</p>
                                  <p>OAuth 2.0 is the industry standard for authentication and will allow for a more modern authorization experience.&nbsp;</p>
                                  <p>The OAuth 2.0 beta lets you test this new functionality in a v2 Project and associated App and give us feedback before a General Availability release. However, since this implementation of OAuth 2.0 is currently in development, we strongly recommend that you refrain from testing on a public, production environment, or app.</p>

                                  <p>Today we are adding two new non-public metrics subfields, <code>user_profile_clicks</code> and <code>url_link_clicks</code>, to the post object in the X Developer Labs post lookup endpoints. They will be returned when using the <code>tweet.fields</code> parameter with any of the following values: <code>non_public_metrics</code>, <code>organic_metrics</code>, or <code>promoted_metrics</code>.</p>

                                  <p>Starting today, X web, iOS and Android will be showing the total 'reposts and comments' count per post. Using the X API, the total 'reposts and comments' number matching the X interface can be calculated by adding the <code>retweet_count</code> and <code>quote_count</code> when available. Additionally <code>quote_count</code> will be the total unique accounts that have quoted the post, rather than the total posts quoting the post.

                                  <p>Today, we are introducing a new operator,&nbsp;is:reply, to help you narrow conversations to those you care about most. You can now filter out replies from your results (in addition to the pre-existing ability to filter out reposts,&nbsp;is:retweet, and Quoted posts,&nbsp;is:quote). This new operator is available today within&nbsp;<a href="/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/tweets/filter-realtime/overview/powertrack-api">PowerTrack</a>,&nbsp;<a href="/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/tweets/batch-historical/overview">Historical PowerTrack</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/tweets/filter-realtime/api-reference/replay-stream">Replay</a>.</p>
                                  <p>The&nbsp;is:reply&nbsp;Boolean operator can be used to filter all replies to posts, or to filter out explicit replies that match a rule. This operator functions in the same way as the&nbsp;is:quote&nbsp;operator.</p>

                                  <p>Today, we are announcing a change to the way that URLs will be rendered in the quote payload.</p>
                                  <p>We’re adding a new entity called the "quoted_status_permalink" entity to ensure the quoted post can be referenced and we will be removing the t.co link from the quoted post "text" field.</p>
                                  <p>With the new format, the t.co link is no longer appended to the "text" field of the quoted post in the "quoted_status" object.</p>
                                  <p>Further, we will no longer put the quoted post t.co url, expanded_url, and display_url in the ‘urls’ entity. Instead, these will be added to a new "quoted_status_permalink" object with "url", "expanded", and "display" URL attributes. This means that the "quoted_status_permalink" object will be reserved for the t.co link back to the quoted post, whereas the "entities.urls" array can be used to identify any links shared within the original post or quote.</p>
